## Project Description

This project is an e-commerce app which lists of items and has multiple filter options for listing those items. The data is being fetched from a JSON file. I did not create any speicific backend API for it. It only allows the user to see list, and apply filters to those list items. It uses redux to manage the state when filtering the data. The images are same because I did not focus on adding different image to database for each item.
